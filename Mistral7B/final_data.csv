At present, it is almost impossible for any carrier to guarantee a transit to any destination - even direct sailings. There is congestion in the ports worldwide which throw vessels off their schedules, creating huge problems in maintaining schedule integrity and forcing carriers to skip vessels in order to make up for the irregularities. In some cases, full stop bookings to certain destinations are implemented. Right now there are ports all over the world which have over 40 vessels at roads waiting their turn to operate. , Having said that, there are delays in sailings and no guarantees regarding eta at destination. Schedules and transit times as given by carriers and announced in their websites and as mentioned in their quotes, transit time and routing are based on published schedules provided by vessel's owner and can be changed without the obligation of a pre notice. , , GSG Global Shipping Group Spa ### Output:{'quantity': '1', 'package_type': 'pallet', 'measures': '120x80xh105 cm', 'total_weight': '390 Kg', 'delivery_port': 'MIAMI', 'company': 'GSG Global Shipping Group Spa'}"
